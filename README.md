# krusty-burger-sequelize

`krusty-burger-sequelize` is a bugger logger that lets uses input the name of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page -- indicating it has been devoured. 

Once devoured, a second button will appear, prompting the user to place another order for the same burger. If clicked, the burger wil be reordered and will move to the left -- waiting to be devoured once more.
